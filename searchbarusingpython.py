# Being able to easily launch a browser can be a useful operation in many scripts. 
# For example, maybe a script performs some kind of deployment to a server and one 
# would like to have it quickly launch a browser so one can verify that itâ€™s working. 
# Or maybe a program writes data out in the form of HTML pages and just like to fire 
# up a browser to see the result. Either way, the webbrowser module is a simple solution.
